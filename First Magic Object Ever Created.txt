Name: Staff of Elemental Fury 

Description: The Staff of Elemental Fury is a slender, polished wooden staff about 5 feet in length, 
adorned with intricate carvings of roaring elemental creatures on its surface. At the top of the staff, 
a large gemstone in swirling shades of blue and green glows with an inner power.

Ability: The Staff of Elemental Fury can be wielded by a spellcaster who possesses at least level 5 in the elemental magic school. 
Upon activation, the staff releases a tidal wave of elemental energy based on the user's innate element (fire, earth, water, or air). 
The wave engulfs the staff's wielder and anything within a 20-foot radius, dealing elemental damage corresponding to the wielder’s 
chosen element (fire damage for fire, etc.). 

The staff’s wielder, however, is immune to the destructive effects of the tidal wave, becoming a conduit for the staff's power.
For a brief period afterward, the wielder is imbued with additional elemental power and can cast spells of their chosen element 
without expending spell slots for the next hour. 

Once the staff's ability is activated, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.

Ancient Protector Armor (Rare, requires attunement)

This magnificent suit of armor has been passed down through generations of noble families and ancient orders, 
each adding its own enchantments and blessings over the years until it has become an unparalleled treasure. 
Its intricate design and intricate etching on the surface resemble that of nature, specifically the texture of tree barks.

When this armor is worn, the wearer gains a +2 bonus to AC. Additionally, the armor grants resistance against bludgeoning, 
piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

Once per day, the wearer can activate the armor's Ancient Protection ability, which surrounds them in a shimmering aura of light.
While Ancient Protection is active, the wearer is immune to all damage for one minute, and the armor's enchantments grant an additional +2 bonus to AC.

This powerful suit of armor also serves as a beacon of hope for allies who see it in action. Whenever the wearer activates Ancient Protection 
or is reduced to 0 hit points, all allies within 60 feet gain temporary hit points equal to the wearer's level + their Charisma modifier.

However, such a powerful artifact does not come without its drawbacks. The wearer of the armor must be proficient in heavy armor and have a Strength score 
of at least 16, otherwise they suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and their movement speed is halved while wearing the armor.

The Blade of Eldritch Thunder

Artifact Weapon (requires attunement)

This ancient sword crackles with otherworldly energy that hums in your hand. The blade itself is made of a dark metal with glowing runes etched along its length. 
The weapon requires attunement by a creature with arcane spellcasting ability.

While attuned to the Blade of Eldritch Thunder, 
the wielder gains the following benefits:

- The sword deals an additional 2d6 lightning damage on a hit.
- The sword has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- Once per day, the wielder can cast the Lightning Bolt spell from the blade without expending a spell slot. 
  The spell's range is extended to 200 feet and its damage is increased to 8d6.
- The wielder can use an action to summon a bolt of lightning to strike a target within 60 feet, dealing 6d6 lightning damage on a failed Dexterity
  saving throw (DC 18). The wielder can use this ability once per day.
- The sword has a special ability that allows it to channel lightning through the ground, creating a massive electrical explosion that deals 8d10 lightning 
  damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius centered on the wielder. The wielder must be standing on conductive terrain such as metal, water, or wet earth
  for this ability to function. The wielder can use this ability once per week.

Curse: The Blade of Eldritch Thunder is cursed, though the wielder may only discover this after prolonged use. As the wielder becomes more reliant on the power 
of the sword, they gradually begin to transform into a being of pure lightning. Their skin crackles with energy, their eyes glow with a blue light, and they must 
make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw after every extended use of the sword to avoid permanent transformation. If the wielder succumbs to the curse, they become an NPC 
under the control of the DM.
